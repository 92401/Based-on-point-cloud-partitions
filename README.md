## 📖 Overview

This project provides a strategy to **partition point cloud data** after sparse reconstruction.  
It is primarily intended for use in **3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)** reconstruction pipelines, enabling efficient division and management of large-scale 3D data.

## 📦 Installation

Clone this repository (including submodules):

```bash
# SSH
git clone --recursive https://github.com/1799967694/Based-on-point-cloud-partitions.git

## ⚙️ Setup

### 🪟 For Windows users
Before installing dependencies, set the following environment variable:

```bash
SET DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1

conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate ptgs

cd Based-on-point-cloud-partitions/scene/ptgs
$env:PYTHONPATH="your_path/Based-on-point-cloud-partitions" 
#Set the code as an environment variable for easy access
python shen_partition_utils.py your_sfm_path

## 📝 Notes

Here are some important tips to keep in mind when running the code:

### 1. Partition Strategy
- By default, the partitioning is performed **along the XY-plane**.
- The **Manhattan rotation matrix** is **not applied** by default.  
  If you want to enable it, simply **uncomment the `man_trans` section** in `shen_partition_utils.py`.
- For details on determining the **Manhattan parameters**, please refer to the following repository:

---

### 2. Threshold Parameter (`threshold_value`)
The parameter `threshold_value = 500000` is related to the **available GPU memory** during training.  
You can adjust this value according to your GPU’s VRAM capacity.

| GPU Memory | Recommended `threshold_value` |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| 24 GB       | 500,000                       |
| 12 GB       | 200,000                       |
| 8 GB        | 100,000                       |

> 💡 **Tip:** If you encounter memory overflow issues, try lowering `threshold_value` accordingly.

## 📸 Example Output

Before running the script, please ensure that your input directory follows the structure below:

your_sfm/
├── images
├── sparse

After successful execution of the partitioning script, the following folder will be generated:
your_sfm/model/
└── split_result/
└── visible/ # Stores the visualization results for each partition

Each subfolder under `visible/` represents **one independent 3DGS input dataset**,  
and the corresponding `.pkl` files record the **partitioning information** for each region.

---

### 🖼️ Visualization Example

Below are sample visualizations of the partitioning results:

> **Figure:** Visualization of the generated partitions under `model/split_result/visible/`.  
> Each folder corresponds to a distinct region of the point cloud that can be processed independently in 3DGS reconstruction.
